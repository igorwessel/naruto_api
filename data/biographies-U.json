      "description": "A Genin from the village of Konoha, Uzumaki Naruto is the container for the Kyuubi Demon Fox. Shortly after he was born, the Kyuubi attacked the village. To stop the demon the Fourth Hokage was forced to imprison it into the body of the young baby Naruto. As Naruto grew up the adults in Leaf Village saw Naruto as the demon fox itself. This feeling was passed on to their children who also looked down on Naruto. Growing up Naruto did not have anyone who really cared him. Because of this Naruto has grown up seeking to have everyone recognize him as being a skilled ninja. To that end his goal is to surpass the Hokage."
