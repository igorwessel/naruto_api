He had the ability to change his body's chakra into magnetic fields. Seeing a previous Shukaku host manipulate sand, Kazekage surmised he could do something similar with tiny pieces of iron. He used this ability to develop \"Satetsu\" or Iron Sand. He could control this sand in any fashion he wished through the magnetic field. This allowed him to form weapons whenever he needed. This jutsu came to be known as Suna's deadliest, and granted him the honor of being called the greatest Kazekage.Click For Quick-Spoilers:Years later it was revealed that Akatsuki member Sasori of the Red Sands, the legendary demented puppet master of Hidden Sand had killed Sandaime Kazekage and then turned him into a puppet. Sasori kept Sandaime as his favorite and best puppet, using him against his grandmother Chiyo and Sakura when they came to rescue Gaara from Akatsuki. Sandaime had been made into a puppet using Sasori's \"Hitokugutsu\" method. This allowed Sasori to use all of Sandaime's jutsu, including his manipulation of the magnetic fields.",
